### A) Create a folder called "myfolder" in the current directory.

Hint: Use the **mkdir** command passing as argument the directory to create


You should see the new folder as the first output of the command **ls -t**


### B) Create a copy of the file "naive_bayes.py" inside "myfolder", and name it "naive_bayes_copy.py".

Hint: Use the **cp** command specifying:
	- path of the file to copy
	- path and name of the new file


### C) Move the file called "multiclass.py" inside the directory "myfolder".

Hint: Use the **mv** command specifying:
	- path of the file to move
	- path you want to move the file in

### D) Check that the directory "myfolder" contains the required files.

Hint: Use the **ls** command

### E) Remove the directory "myfolder".

This task can be performed in two differnt ways:

1) First way:
- Remove manually the files inside "myfolder" (using the **rm** command specifiyng the file to delete)
- Remove the folder using the **rmdir** command specifiyng the directory name (works only on empty folder)


2) Second way:
- Recursively remove the folder "myfolder" and all the files inside it. Using the **rm** command passing the arguments **-R** and the directory to delete.
