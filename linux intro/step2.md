### A) List the contents of the current directory

Hint: Use the command **ls**

Try out few parameters of the *ls* command, passing the following arguments:
	- **-F** (append an indicator of the file type)
	- **-l** (output detailed information on the directory)
	- **-S** (sort the results by name)
	- **-t** (sort the results by modification)
	- **-R** (display a recursive listing)

Notice that you can combine two or more argument.

```
ls -lR
```{{execute}}


### B) List the contents of the directory ~/datasets, sorted by name.

Hint: This task can be solved passing the required directory as argument to the command **ls**

### C) Recursively List the contents of the directory ~/neural_network, sorted by last modification.

Hint: Combine the arguments **-R** and **-t**, specifying the required directory
