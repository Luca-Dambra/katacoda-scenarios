### A) List the contents of the current directory

```
ls
```{{execute}}

Try out few parameters of the *ls* command, passing the following arguments:
	- *-F* (append an indicator of the file type)
	- *-l* (output detailed information on the directory)
	- *-S* (sort the results by name)
	- *-t* (sort the results by modification)
	- *-R* (display a recursive listing)

Hint: you can combine two or more argument.

```
ls -lR
```{{execute}}


### B) List the contents of the directory /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/sklearn/datasets, sorted by name.

```
ls -S /datasets
```{{execute}}
