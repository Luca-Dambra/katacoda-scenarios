In this Demo we will work with files contained in the well-known python library "sklearn". Thus, the first thing to do, is to download and install the library.
We perform this step using the Python Package Index (pip):

```
pip install sklearn
```{{execute}}

The download may take few minutes depending on the internet connection.

### A) Find inside the folder "/usr" the path to the folder named "sklearn".

Hint: use the **find** command specifing:
- the directory of interest
- the argument **-name** (means that it will search files and folder with a specific name)
- the name of file or folder you are looking for

### B) Move inside the directory named "sklearn". 

Hint: use the command **cd** passing the required directory as argument

### C) Check that you are inside the right folder.

Hint: compare the output of the command **pwd** with the required path
